						<h2>Speaker Speakerson the First</h2>
						<h5>From the misty river mountain-tops</h5>
						<p>Pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath. It was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but has mastered it and now is quiet.</p>

						<h5>About Speaker</h5>
						<p>And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come. For I also am a steward. Did you not know?’ And with that he turned and strode from the hall with Pippin running at his side.</p>

						<h2>Speaker Speakerson the Second</h2>
						<h5>In the red trunks, coming out the red corner...</h5>
						<p>He knew now why Beregond spoke his name with love. He was a captain that men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the black wings.</p>
